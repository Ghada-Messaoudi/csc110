You are planning to drive from Seattle to Spokane (279 miles), but your rental car has only a metric speedometer.  

Write a Python program that prompts for a speed in kilometers per hour, and prints out the expected trip duration in hours.

Submit the completed program as a text file named homework1.py

Your submission should include the following:

* Comments with the program name, your name and the due date
* Comments with pseudocode describing the program steps
* Fully functional Python code
* Output in the format - "Trip duration is: <result>", where <result> is the calculated hours in decimal format.

Note -

* 1 km = 0.6214 miles
* Don't worry about rounding your answer
* Be sure to test the program with different speeds and check that the results are mathematically correct
