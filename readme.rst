**Class Details**

* Location: SAM 0202
* Time: MW 3:00 - 5:30 pm
* Dates:  9/26/2016 - 12/15/2016

* Credits: 5
* Prerequisites: MAT 98 (Intermediate Algebra) with 2.0 or better

**Summary**

This class introduces basic concepts and techniques of computer science & programming with practical exercises using the Python programming language. Students will learn to: 

* Create expressions that use data variables, arithmetic, and logical operators
* Use conditional statements, loops, functions & objects 
* Use proper syntax and design guidelines when writing a computer program
* Apply programming concepts to solve a variety of logical problems

**Required Materials**

We will use "Python Programming: an introduction to computer science" by John Zelle. Franklin, Beedle & Associates Inc. 2nd edition, as our primary text. Additional readings will be made available on the class pages in Canvas. 

Students will also need the following:

* A computer with Python 3.4 or later installed 
* A modern, syntax-highlighting text editor such as Sublime Text, Brackets, Komodo Edit, Atom

Note - Students can use a free online Python coding environment such as https://c9.io/ or https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ rather than configure their own computer.

**Class Structure and Topics**

Each week, we'll cover a different topic, building on the previous week's work. In general, we will cover new material in Monday lectures, and Wednesday labs will focus on practicing what youâ€™ve learned. We will cover the following topics, although the order and precise list is subject to revision:

1. Computer Science, Programming, Setting up Python
#. Basics of Python programs
#. Computing with numbers 
#. Strings & file I/O
#. Conditional statements & logical operators
#. Loops
#. Functions
#. Data collections
#. Objects & classes
#. Graphics

**Grading**

Grades will be based on weekly assignments, 2 quizzes, and a final exam.

Weekly assignments will be posted on Canvas each Wednesday and are designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week. Assignments are due by the start of class on the following Monday, and late assignments will be automatically marked down by 20%. 

There will also be 2 quizzes and a final exam. Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and must be completed during a specified time frame to receive credit.
